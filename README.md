# Jenkins demo
This GitHub organization is for Jenkins, Inc., which is a hypothetical company that uses Jenkins.
We use this and http://demo.jenkins-ci.org/ to illustrate a best practice usage of Jenkins with
realistic data.

## Goals
* Highlight key parts of noteworthy features in Jenkins 2.0 through a functioning live Jenkins
  instance that people can experience just with a browser
* Eventually evolve into a permanent demo instance to show off various noteworthy features
  beyond initial 2.0 GA

## Key Ingredients
* A fictional company “Jenkins, Inc.” is introduced as users of the demo instance
* Justifiable Continuous Delivery pipeline that highlights the following
    * Organization folder
    * Multiple branches
    * Really concise Jenkinsfile in repos + actual definitions in global library
    * Staged deployment to multiple environments
    * Docker Integration
* Live & real-looking data so that people without the context can easily the applications & development processes that are being automated
* A web page to walk people through the demo with hyperlinks
