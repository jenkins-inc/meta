# Jenkins, Inc. Continuous Delivery walkthrough
## Who we are and what we do
Jenkins, Inc. is a small startup in [Neverland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverland) that develops a web application, which consists of microservices.

We have a fully automated Continuous Delivery pipeline through [Jenkins 2.0](http://jenkins-ci.org/2.0/), where commits made by engineers go through a series of environments and tests and eventually hit production all automatically.
